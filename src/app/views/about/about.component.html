                    <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span> is social network oriented to multimedia consumption submitted by the user, and general discussion.
                    <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span> was created by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/italo-russo/">Italo Russo</a>.
                    On <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span>, "Personas" are the first-class citizens. A Persona can post, vote, comment and create channels.

            <span style="display: block;">
                <p>
                    User accounts may have one or multiple Personas. Channels are managed by their respective Persona (mods).
                    They establish rules and are in their power to ban any Persona who doesn't comply with them. 
                </p>
                <p>                
                    A Mod Persona of a channel has the power to ban another Persona and its user account, so no other Persona from that account will be able to post,
                    but the Mod Persona cannot see the account owner of that Persona or its other Personas. This ensures strict anonymity with everyone, including from staff members.

                        Global Rules apply to all channels. Violation of some of these rules may result in a permanent
                        ban for the user or Persona, and/or content deletion.

                    <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span> allows for images and videos uploads with certain limitations. Images are restricted to PNG, JPG, BMP and GIF of up to
                    10 megabytes(10737418240 bytes) per image. Videos, on the other hand, are restricted to WEBM and MP4 of up to 10 megabytes(10737418240 bytes) and 6 minutes time limitation per video.
                    A post is limited to 10 images or 5 videos. A post may consist of images and videos, where a video is equivalent to 2 images. This means a post may consist 2 videos and 6 images, or
                    4 videos and 2 images, and so on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Channels may be setup so only a specific type of content is allowed. For example, a channel may have audio disabled on its videos. A video uploaded to this kind of 
                    channel will be stripped off of its audio completely. Another example would be a channel where only images are allowed to be uploaded.
