                    <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span> is social network oriented to multimedia consumption submitted by the user and general discussion.
                    <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span> was created by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/italo-russo/">Italo Russo</a>.
                    On <span class="about-title-pixi">Pixi</span>, "Personas" are the first-class citizens. A Persona can post, vote, comment and create channels.

                <p>
                    User accounts can have one or multiple Personas. Channels are managed by their respective Persona (mods).
                    They establish rules and are in their power to ban any Persona who doesn't comply with them. 
                </p>
                <p>                
                    A Mod Persona on a channel can ban another Persona and its user account, so no other Persona from that account can post, but the Mod Persona cannot see the owner
                    of the Persona or its other Personas. This ensures strict anonymity with everyone, including staff members.
